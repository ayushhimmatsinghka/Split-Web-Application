# Even-split

Our product aims to help students manage their expenses in an efficient way. When travelling in a group, keeping track of every transaction can be difficult and often leads to uneven expenditures. Our product will help manage these expenses and allow students to document their personal expenses on food, groceries, travel, etc. This will help them optimize their finances and keep a better track of their spending.

Note:- The calendar feature of our product is currently in its prototype stage, and we plan to integrate it with the expenses management feature in the future. It will serve as an integrated platform that displays the academic timetable and events and expenses of all clubs and societies, allowing students to schedule their day efficiently and avoid any clashes between events.
